# MotionCut-Java_Internship
## **OVERVIEW**

This repository contains 5 Java projects that were developed as part of a programming internship. Each project aims to reinforce fundamental Java concepts through practical application. The projects included are:

**1) Online Quiz Application**

**2) Link Shortener Development**

**3) Expense Tracker**

**4) Text-based Adventure Game**

**5) Brick Breaker Game**


## **Project Summaries**

### **1) Online Quiz Application**

A console-based quiz system to reinforce core Java concepts like variables, loops, and arrays.

Features:

♦ Question and Quiz classes: Encapsulate the properties and behaviors related to individual questions and the quiz as a whole.

♦ User-friendly interface: Ensures ease of interaction for users.

♦ Scoring and input validation: Accurately tracks scores and validates user inputs to ensure a smooth experience.

##

### **2) Link Shortener Development**

A simple application to shorten long URLs and expand short URLs back to their original form.

Features:

♦ URL management classes: Handle the storage and retrieval of original and shortened URLs.

♦ Basic hash function: Provides a mechanism to generate short, unique codes for long URLs.

♦ Error handling: Ensures robustness by managing potential issues gracefully.

##

### **3. Expense Tracker**

An application for managing and monitoring expenses.

Features:

♦ User registration: Allows multiple users to maintain separate expense records.

♦ Expense entry and listing: Enables users to add new expenses and view existing ones.

♦ Category-wise summation: Provides a summary of expenses categorized by type.

♦ Data persistence: Ensures that data is stored and can be retrieved across sessions.

##

### **4. Text-based Adventure Game**

An interactive narrative experience where users make choices that influence the outcome of the story.

Features:

♦ Interactive Storyline: Design a compelling narrative with multiple decision points.

♦ User Choices: Allow users to make decisions that impact the direction of the game.

♦ Outcome Variability: Provide different endings based on user decisions.

♦ Error Handling: Manage and respond to invalid inputs gracefully.

♦ User-Friendly Interface: Ensure clear instructions and intuitive interaction for players.

##

### **5. Brick Breaker Game**

An interactive narrative experience where users make choices that influence the outcome of the story.

Features:

♦ Game Logic: Develop core mechanics for paddle movement, ball bouncing, and brick destruction. Include collision detection and a scoring system.

♦ Levels and Difficulty: Design multiple levels with increasing complexity and adjust difficulty by altering ball speed and introducing challenges.

♦ User Input: Enable keyboard input for paddle control, and add features like pausing and restarting.

♦ Sound Effects and Music: Enhance the gaming experience with sound effects for ball hits, brick breaks, and background music.

♦ Game Over and Victory Conditions: Implement conditions for game over and define victory conditions for completing levels.

♦ Optimizations: Optimize code for better performance, considering features like double buffering.

♦ Documentation: Provide clear documentation and comments for the codebase to aid understanding.
